Stacks dimensions...
If you're changing the material of the bedrock floor, you can head to the 'overworld_floor' function and replace "bedrock" for whatever you want.
If you'd like to change the portal heights/dimensions, the files you're concerned with are "overworld_floor", "nether_roof_spacing", and "nether_roof_two".
