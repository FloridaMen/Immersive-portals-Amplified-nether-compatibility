Stacks dimensions...
If you're changing the material of the bedrock floor, you can head to the 'break' function and replace "bedrock" for whatever you want.
If you'd like to change the portal heights/dimensions, the files you're concerned with are "overworld_floor", "nether_roof_spacing", and "nether_roof_two".

If you downloaded this pack as a zip and it does not work, extract and make sure that the filepath goes 
datapacks/Immersive-portals-Amplified-nether-compatibility/data, and not 
datapacks/Immersive-portals-Amplified-nether-compatibility/Immersive-portals-Amplified-nether-compatibility/data
